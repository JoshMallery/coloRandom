## Applicaiton Features

* Every time the user clicks the New Palette button, a new set of colors is created and displayed.
* When the user clicks Save Palette, the saved palette should show up in the saved palette side of the UI.
* Each saved palette should be rendered with a button to delete the palette (you won’t build out this functionality until a later iteration)
* A new Palette should automatically be created and displayed in the main part of the app.
* A user should be able to click a color in the Palette and lock it.
* When the New Palette button is clicked, all the colors update as expected, except for any colors that are locked
* A user should be able to unlock colors and continue updating the colors with the New Palette button as expected
* When a saved palette’s delete button is clicked, that palette is removed from the page.
